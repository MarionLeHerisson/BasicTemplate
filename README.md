# BasicTemplate
I don't recommand its usage since I found some issues ! Be patient and wait for me to fix it :)

My home-made basic template to create simple websites.

Simple MVC with clean URLs. Includes some Google fonts, jquery, Bootstrap css & js.

In the project, search everything like "basic_template" and replace it with your website/directory name.
Application/Model folder contains one file per table in your database. "someTableNameModel.php" is an example.
Also fill 'prod_const.php' and put it in your .gitignore.

Improvements to come :
- clean error handling
- command line tool for initialisation

Hope you enjoy it ! Every feedback is appreciated :)
