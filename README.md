# BasicTemplate
My home-made basic template to create simple websites.

Simple MVC with clean URLs. Includes some Google fonts, jquery, Bootstrap css & js.

In the project, search everything like "WONDERFUL_WEBSITE" and replace it with your website/directory name.
Also put 'prod_const.php' in your .gitignore.

Improvements to come :
- clean error handling
- command line tool for initialisation

Hope you enjoy it ! Every feedback appreciated :)
